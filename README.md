# Programming Practices
## Commenting
A comment should be concise, relevant, and informative. Always comment before a function, method, class, etc. about the role of said code.
## Naming Conventions
Variable names should be consistent and understandable. Avoid overly long variable names and names matching other elements of the code. For style consistency, variables should be all lowercase and use underscores in place of spaces.

# Project Practices
## Github Model
The project will have a project branch and a developer branch. Only stable and tested code should be applied to the project branch. If necessary, create feature branches of the dev branch.
## Commits
Commit often, and always comment on the changes in your commits. Commits should not contain any unfinished work or program-breaking features that are not documented with a high-priority issue on Jira and known by all team members.
