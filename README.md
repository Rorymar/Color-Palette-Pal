# Programming Practices
## Commenting
A comment should be concise, relevant, and informative. Always comment before a function, method, class, etc. about the role of said code.
## Naming Conventions
Variable names should be consistent and understandable. Avoid overly long variable names and names matching other elements of the code. For style consistency, variable names should be camel-case and function names should begin with capital letters.
## Spacing
Tab spacing should be 4 characters wide and there should be one empty line between function definitions
##Brace Placement
Braces should begin on the line following that of the class declaration, function declaration, and loop conditions

# Project Practices
## Github Model
The project will have a project branch and a developer branch. Only stable and tested code should be applied to the project branch. If necessary, create feature branches of the dev branch.
## Commits
Commit often, and always comment on the changes in your commits. Commits should not contain any unfinished work or program-breaking features that are not documented with a high-priority issue on Jira and are known by all team members.
